# Karmachari Portal — Blue Government Theme (Extended)

This is a starter React + Tailwind CSS frontend styled to resemble an official government portal (blue/white theme).
It includes pages for Student, Principal, Employer, ALO, Login, Register, and Reports — with mock data and UI-only flows.

Run locally:
1. unzip the folder
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run dev`

Notes & Troubleshooting:
- The project uses `vite.config.mjs` (ESM). If your Node/npm setup gives warnings about ESM/CJS, ensure your Node is up-to-date (Node 20+ recommended).
- If you see plugin engine warnings, run `npm install` anyway; the app should still work. If not, tell me your Node version and I will adjust versions.
